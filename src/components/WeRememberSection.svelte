					UMPQUA STRONG was created after the tragic events on October 1st, 2015 at Umpqua Community
					College which left our community bereft of 9 beautiful souls. This small, tight knit
					community felt itself rocked to the core from the events of that day and we will never be
					the same again.

					We will always remember Jason, Treven, Sarena, Rebecka, Quinn, Lucero, Lucas, Lawrence and
					Kim.
